# 👋 Hi there, welcome!

I'm a passionate software engineer with over 8 years of experience in Java development — especially with **Spring Boot**, **RESTful APIs**, and **microservices**. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy building maintainable, scalable, and testable systems. I'm currently diving deeper into **cloud technologies** like AWS, and software design/architecture fundamentals, like Design Patterns.
